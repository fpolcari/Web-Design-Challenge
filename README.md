# Web-Design-Challenge

We were tasked with creating a website by using either the visualizations that you created for your Python-APIs Challenge or the weather data and images that are provided for this Challenge. I opted to use my Python-APIs challenge homework and related images.

As the dashboard was being built, we had to create a page for each plot and a way to navigate among these pages. These pages contain the visualizations and the related descriptions. Additioanlly, we created two more pages. One is a landing page that provides a comparison of all the plots. The other is a page that presents the data used to build the plots.

Some of the considerations were as follows:
We had to use Bootstrap which included a Bootstrap navbar component for the header on every page, the Bootstrap grid for responsiveness on the comparison page, and the Bootstrap table component for the data page.
We also had to deploy our webpage to GitHub Pages, and as a result, the website works at a live, publicly accessible URL.
We were expected to use CSS media query that uses Bootstrap and/or @media for the navigation bar.
And finally, we had to make sure that your website works at all window widths.
